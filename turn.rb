# Turn prints the gameplay prompts. It captures the current player's input and compares it to the correct answer and responds, calling the player method to reduce the lives if appropriate.

# class Turn
#   def initialize
#     @problem = Problem.new
#   end
#   puts "Player #{@current_player}: #{@q}"
#   answer = gets.chomp.to_i
#   answer == @problem.a
# end
